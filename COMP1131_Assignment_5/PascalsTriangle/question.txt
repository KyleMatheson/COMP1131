Design and implement a recursive program to determine and print up to the Nth line of Pascalâ€™s Triangle,
as shown below. Each interior value is the sum of the two values above it.

Set 3 Img 1
Hints: You might use an array to hold the values for a given line, although that is not necessary.
It is not necessary to format the output exactly as presented above.

One recursive approach is:

T(r, 0) = T(r, r) = 1

T(r, c) = T(r - 1, c - 1) + T(r - 1, c)

Include at least three test runs of different sizes.
